# Snag to PNG

This script converts pulls out the PNG image from a SnagX screenshot file. It does not
include any of the SnagX metadata or annotations.

## Usage

```
python convertsnag.py <input_file or wildcard> [-o <output_file>]
```

Output file is optional. If not specified, the PNG image will have the same name as the input file, but with a `.png` extension.
